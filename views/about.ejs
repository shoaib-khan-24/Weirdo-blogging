        <p class="para">Weirdos is blogging platform for weird people to read blogs of other weird people and hence become more weirder. Our objective is to help these weird people because often these type of people suffer through loneliness and their loneliness can be cured only if we let them connect with people same as them.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="para">I am Shoaib, founder of weirdos and CEO, CTO, CFO and all the other reputed posts that you can think of. I created this platform to cure the society's problem of people getting less weird. Social media only provides the useful and educational content these days and it is so disturbing that people with mental & psychological problems can't find entertainment on these platforms anymore. Someone has to stood up for them and here I am with WEIRDOS to help all these dumbf*cks to spend their day on screen reading stupid shit.</p>
